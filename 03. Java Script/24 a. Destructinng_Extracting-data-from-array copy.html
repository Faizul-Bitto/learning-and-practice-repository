      // if we have array and we want to extract the elements from the array and assign to new variables, instead of doing it manually, we can do like this, which is called destructing:
      const array = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100];

      const [first1, second1, third1] = array;
      document.write(first1 + "<br />");
      document.write(second1 + "<br />");
      document.write(third1 + "<br />");

      // let's say we need just first and last element from the array
      const [first2, , , , , , , , last2] = array; // first element is 10, second element is 20, third element is 30, fourth element is 40, fifth element is 50, sixth element is 60, seventh element is 70, eighth element is 80, last element is 90; so which elements we don't need to extract, keep those positions blank

      document.write(first2 + "<br />");
      document.write(last2 + "<br />");
