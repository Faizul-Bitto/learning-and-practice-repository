      /**
      .sort() method : The .sort() method by default only works with strings. It converts array elements to strings and sorts them lexicographically (dictionary order) by default. This works fine for strings but can lead to unexpected results with numbers/floats because they are compared as strings. To sort numbers/floats, we must provide a compare function as an argument to the .sort() method. This compare function defines the sorting logic.
      sort syntax:
      arrayVariableName.sort();
      **/
      const result = array.sort(); // in result variable it will store the sorted array

      document.write(result + "<br />"); // ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "mango", "orange"]

      // for numbers sorting
      const numbers = [15, 10, 25, 40, 35, 22.5];
      const result1 = numbers.sort((a, b) => {
        return a - b;
      }); // in result variable it will store the sorted array

      // we can also write like this for simple statement/logic
      const result2 = numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);
      document.write(result1 + "<br />"); // [10, 15, 22.5, 25, 35, 40]
      document.write(result2); // [10, 15, 22.5, 25, 35, 40]

      /**
       * Strings: .sort() works without extra logic (default lexicographical sorting).
       * Numbers/Floats: we need to provide a compare function for accurate sorting.
