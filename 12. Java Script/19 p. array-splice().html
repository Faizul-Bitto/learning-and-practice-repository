      .splice() method : It will remove the elements from the array from the given starting index to the number of elements that we want to remove, even we can add the elements to the array
      splice syntax: 
      arrayVariableName.splice(startingIndexThatWillBeRemoved, removeTheNumberOfElementsWeWantFromGivenStartingIndex);
      splice can take multiple parameters:
      arrayVariableName.splice(startingIndexThatWillBeRemoved, removeTheNumberOfElementsWeWantFromGivenStartingIndex, itemsToBeAddedIfWeWant, itemsToBeAddedIfWeWant, itemsToBeAddedIfWeWant...);

      const spliceMethod = array.splice(5, 2); // for starting index we are giving 5 and for number of elements we are giving 2, that means we are removing 2 elements from index 5 and this variable holding the spliced
      document.write(`${spliceMethod} are replaced <br />`); // [60, 70]
      document.write(array + "<br />"); // updated array : [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 80, 90, 100]

So one the index 5, and for number of elements we are giving 2, on the value of 60 and 70, we are adding 55, 66 and 77, that means 60 will be replaced by 55, 66 and 77

So one the index 5, and for number of elements we are giving 0, before the value of 80, we are adding 55, 66 and 77
